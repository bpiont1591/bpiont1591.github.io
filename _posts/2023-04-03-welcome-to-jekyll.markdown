You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{
  "name": "voteban",
  "permissions": "NONE",
  "restriction": "1",
  "_id": "UiLgh",
  "actions": [
    {
      "member": "1",
      "varName": "",
      "info": "21",
      "storage": "1",
      "varName2": "username",
      "name": "Store Member Info"
    },
    {
      "member": "1",
      "varName": "",
      "info": "1",
      "storage": "1",
      "varName2": "id",
      "name": "Store Member Info"
    }
